Notes from [the Growth Mindset publication](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset):

### **"Growth mindset" in my own words:**

* The purpose of the *Growth Mindset* is to keep us more productive throughout the day so that we feel more accomplished;
* *Growth Mindset* is the opposite of the *Fixed Mindset*, mainly because it embraces challanges and learns from feedback;
* We can use certain techniques to pull ourveslves into 'growth-iness' and leave the fixed-mindedness.

### **Growth reminders to myself:**

* When we get stuck solving a problem, it is important to take a step back, then return to the problem with a fresh vision and start looking through it step by step. In *Growth Mindset* we don't avoid problems, and we recognize that we need to take a break if we feel very stuck;
* Sometimes we lose focus when we come across a difficult task. In order to avoid being distracted, we can mentally recognize that we are about to distract ourselves, and this mental acceptance can usually give us just enough inspiration to keep being focused;
* Use the success of others as an inspiration, not as a threat.

## Learning Markdown Notes

### Learning Markdown is not only a great introduction to learning HTML and CSS, but it is also very useful within GitHub for creating webpages. 
 ***GitHub*** is a platform that stores your code and allows other coders to view and share your code. _GitHub_ is also a great place to showcase your coding projects to your employer.

 One cool thing that GitHub has is called ***GitHub Pages***. You don't store code in _GitPages_ - its purpose is to store notes. 
 The notes can describe:
* A project we work on;
* Competencies and skills you have as a coder; 
* Or it can even serve as a simple website 

We use ***Markdown*** to create syntax in GitHub Pages. It looks similar to HTML, but it is much easier to use because it is less complicated *(at least it is my impression of Markdown)*.

### With ***Markdown***, we can do cool things like:
* Creating an unordered list; 
  * Creating a nested list with *italicized*, ~~strikethrough~~, <sub> Subscript </sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> **bold text**. ***So cool!***
* > Insearting a quote, even an *italicized quote*;
* Sharing [a useful link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax);
* [x] Creating a task;
   * [ ] Or an unfinished task; 
* Even inserting an image:

###### Markdown is not perfect, and it has some ***bugs*** that coders are working for fix. 

###### For example, you can't really use emojis in your text. ***So Sad!***
###### Markdown has emojis incorporated in its syntax, but the problem is that they will not get properly rendered into your GitHub Webpage, and they will just show as code. For example, here is an emoji of  :shipit:  that doesn't work, so you're justing seeing the text, not the actual emoji picture. *What a bummer!* 


#### To sum it up, ***GitHub Pages*** is an efficient tool for creating a website and showcase anything you have in mind. ***Markdown*** allows us to create and edit the text within GitHub Pages, and it has a lot of valuable features to organize our text.
